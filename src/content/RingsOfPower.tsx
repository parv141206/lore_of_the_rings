    "The Rings of Power is an epic fantasy series set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It explores the rise of evil, the forging of powerful rings, and the uniting of unlikely heroes across Elves, Dwarves, and Men. As Middle-earth faces threats both ancient and unseen, familiar characters like Galadriel and Elrond stand alongside new figures in a story of friendship, betrayal, and resilience in the shadow of impending darkness.",

          In the First Age of Tolkien's universe, Middle-earth is young, and the
          world is shaped by the Valar, godlike beings who watch over its
          creation. Elves awaken, and the beautiful land of Valinor is formed
          across the sea.{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-black"> The Dark Lord Morgoth</span>,
          a fallen Valar, corrupts the land and steals the Silmarils, radiant
          jewels created by Fëanor. This theft sparks centuries of conflict, as
          Elves and Men wage epic wars against Morgoth's forces. Ultimately, the
          Valar intervene, leading to Morgoth's defeat, ending the First Age.
